# Generating abstract art using neural networks 

Jupyter notebook corresponding to tutorial: [Making deep neural networks paint to understand how theyÂ work](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-deep-neural-networks-paint-to-understand-how-they-work-4be0901582ee)

Requires following packages:
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Example art

Note : had to use the gif version which destroys the quality of the video, but you can see the original, albeit still compressed [here.](https://giant.gfycat.com/WhiteWastefulDamselfly.webm) If you generate some, they will look as good as the image below, but animated.
